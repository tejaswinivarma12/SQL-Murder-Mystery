🔍 SQL Murder Mystery — Data Investigation & Analysis Project

Tools: SQL • Joins • CTEs • Subqueries • Filtering • Aggregations
Domain: Data Analysis / Crime & Investigation Analytics
Skills: Logical reasoning, data cleaning, validation, root-cause investigation

## *Story / Background*

The CEO of *TechNova Inc.* has been found dead in their office on *October 15, 2025, at 9:00 PM*.
You are the *lead data analyst* tasked with solving this case using SQL. All the clues you need are hidden in the company’s databases:

- Keycard logs
- Phone call records
- Alibis
- Evidence found in different rooms

🛠 SQL Techniques Used

JOINs: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN to connect suspects, crimes, and witness data

CTEs: To break down the investigation into clean, modular steps

Filtering: WHERE clauses, pattern matching, exclusion criteria

Subqueries: To extract nested insights and eliminate wrong suspects

Aggregations: For event counts, time patterns, and record validation

Data Validation: Cross-checking clues across multiple tables

🧠 Approach

Explored table structures to understand relationships

Filtered crime scene records based on location & date

Analyzed witness statements to extract initial clues

Narrowed suspects using JOINs + behavior patterns

Used CTEs to combine multi-step logic cleanly

Cross-verified evidence to avoid false positives

Identified the final suspect with confidence

🏁 Conclusion

By combining SQL joins, filtering, CTEs, and logical reasoning, I successfully identified the killer using a fully data-driven approach.
This project strengthened my problem-solving, data validation, and multi-table analysis skills — all essential for real-world analytics roles.
